# Notes
__A place to put notes, untill I've written `jote`__

Sod this stupid Ramda shit, it adds no security and only confuses things, just have an eval :/

## Handling other apps:
Objects should have an `apps` field, populated with UUIDs
These UUIDs should refference to an object that contains information about the apps that can be used to view the object.

# Notes
__A place to put notes, untill I've written `jote`__

## ToDo:
work on jask first, get a CLI and web app version
get the CLI version working first, then build the server, then build a web client
Get the reccurence middleware working, you'll hate yourself if you don't
but then just get a fucking CLI interface working, I'm getting tired of having to ToDo manager.



## Handling other apps:
Objects should have an `apps` field, populated with UUIDs
These UUIDs should refference to an object that contains information about the apps that can be used to view the object.

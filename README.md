## jec-engine
The core logic and processing of the JEC system.
This is a tool that accepts a stream of JEC compliant actions, and calculates the total state of a JEC instance. It also provides a querying language for reading data, and generating new actions.

## jec-config-fetcher
A package for reading the .jecrc.js config file that is used to configure all command line JEC tools

## jec-server
An HTTP server to wrap a running [`jec-engine`](#jec-engine) instance.

## jec-cli-interface
A package for provide an interface that a CLI querying provider must adhere to.
A JEC enabled CLI program shouldn't have to handle the full [`jec-engine`](#jec-engine) itself, so this package provides an interface for accessing the state.
There are two main implmentations, detailed below:

## jec-pure-cli
This CLI provider queries the filesystem for all actions, and reconstructs the full state on each run. This is simple, but ineficient

## jec-client-cli
This CLI provider queries a [`jec-server`](#jec-server) on each run. The server can stay active between queries, meaning that each query can be run much faster. This does however, require running a server.

## jec-jask
The first JEC enabled tool, which is a simple ToDo list manager.
